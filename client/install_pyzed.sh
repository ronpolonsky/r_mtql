# Install pyzed (ZED SDK Python bindings) into the client venv.
#
# Why this is a separate step:
#   The pyzed cp311 wheel declares `numpy>=2.0` in its metadata, but DROID's
#   stack pins older deps that resolve to numpy 1.x. The binary actually works
#   fine against numpy 1.26 — only the metadata is overly conservative. So we
#   bypass the resolver with `uv pip install --no-deps`.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - ZED SDK installed at /usr/local/zed (https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/)
#   - client/.venv already created via `uv sync`, or
#     UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT pointing at an alternate venv (for example /dev/shm)
#
# Run from the repo root: bash client/install_pyzed.sh
